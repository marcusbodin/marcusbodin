			<h2>"Everything here is fantastic!"</h2>

			<p>
			Just finished my first week at Capgemini. Here's a slight exaggeration of how it feels:
			<br/><br/>

			<br/><br/>
			But seriously, everything feels great and I haven't met anyone who isn't polite and outgoing yet. We are 8 new graduates in Stockholm with different positions and backgrounds so it's very interesting to hear everyones' story. The first three days have been full of introductions and information so friday's after work couldn't have come at a better time. We went out with some of the graduates from the previous batch for some beers and burgers.
			<br/><br/>
			Next week I'll begin learning about the project management strategy at Backelite (the name of the digital design agency at Capgemini where I'll be working). On monday we'll also get to meet the rest of the graduates from Sweden. Looking forward to it!
			<br/><br/>
			I'll probably be pretty preoccupied next week but I'll try posting an update at the end of the week or something. See ya!

			<h2>New adventures ahead!</h2>
			<p>
			Although I've enjoyed my time at Combitech I've felt that the work tasks weren't quite for me. Sure it was really cool to work with developing a fighter jet at Saab, but I felt I wasn't really living up to my potential.
			<br/><br/>
			Luckily, a new opportunity has come up! Starting February this year I'll be working at Capgemini in Stockholm. My role there will be as a Junior Project Analyst in their graduate program. More specifically I'll be working for Backelite, which is owned by Capgemini. Backelite is a service design agency, which means I'll be working closer to the end user.
			<br/><br/>

			Working closer to the end user has been a high priority for me while applying for jobs, so it feels awesome to finally get to do it. Also, the whole IT business seems really fun and interesting so I think I'm going to enjoy it a lot!
			<br/><br/>
			It's a bit sad leaving all the fun colleagues I've gotten to know at Combitech and Saab, but hopefully I'll stay in touch with some of them.

			<h2>I think I'm getting the hang of this...</h2>
			<p>
			...well at least of the HTML and CSS part. I just recently started learning some Java script but I feel like I want to get the site nice and clean before I begin with any cool effects.
			<br/><br/>
			The most demanding part has definitely been creating a responsive site. As you'll notice, if you start messing with the browser window size, the content changes with the size of the window. The site is also responsive to smart-phones and tablets to make it more appealing and easier to use.
			<br/><br/>
			I think I'll probably take a brake from developing the site for a little while now so that I can focus on studying for the CTP-(Combitech Talent Program) course and the IPMA-certification coming up in January.
